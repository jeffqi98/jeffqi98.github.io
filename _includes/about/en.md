Hi, I’m **Jeffrey**. A recent graduate who has been working hard for a while. I have some knowledge of web front-end and iOS development (but I have almost forgotten them by now), but **photography** is my true passion. I wish these two could be my hobbies rather than my jobs. In the current work environment, I feel like my interest and enthusiasm are being worn away by the demands of work, and I’m not clever enough to break the rules. So even if it means losing some professional skills due to not engaging in related fields for a long time, I would rather choose this way than sacrificing my personal passion and energy for the sake of efficiency and industry experience.

Nowadays, I believe that we can change our lifestyle and work mode to some extent, without being constrained by tradition. I also believe that life should not be only about stress and sadness. Life should be the most romantic 24fps. Someday, you will meet the person you have always wanted to see, you will go to the place you have always wanted to go, on a sunny afternoon, the breeze will blow, and when you look back at your past self, you will find that “he” has always been shining.
